###### **This page is to share some of the projects I worked on** (*click on the titles to view repo*)

## **Project one:** [WaveGame](https://github.com/Henokk-14/WaveGame)
**Description:** Modified a game using Java that includes multiple levels, lives, and also has two modes called *Easy mode* and *Hard mode*. It was cool and fun to work on an existing game and add levels and fix bugs to improve it.

**Challenges:** One of the challenges I faced was learning to use git for the first time. It was important for us to use git because it was a group project and git allowed us to work together asynchronously. A second challenge was building on to an existing project. It was hard to figure out what the different classed did because of the amount of bugs that it contained.


## **Project two:** [StockApp](https://github.com/Bsully505/StockInformationBSHK)
**Description:** Created an app with a friend Bryan Sullivan. The app is created using Xcode and in Swift language. The idea is to create a stock app similar to RobinHood but without actually using real money. This allows people interested in the stocks to get the experience of buying and selling but don't actually risk losing money. We think this makes it easy to learn the dangers and rewards of stocks before actually doing it.

**Challenges:** One of the challenges was using Xcode which was a new thing for me. Then to run the app you either using a Virtual memory on your computer which was slow or through connecting your phone directly and downloading it directly.
